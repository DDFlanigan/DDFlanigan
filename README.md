<!--
**DDFlanigan/DDFlanigan** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on buidling my Data Analytics skillset
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, Python, Tableau, and PowerBI
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Analytics Projects, ideally in the healthdcare sector
